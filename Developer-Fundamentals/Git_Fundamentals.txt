Git allows devs to track versions of their code over time

Must use git init to initialize a repository with git before you can start using it

git status will check if a git repository is already started

To remove git repository use mf -rf .git to delete the git folder

How to use git
    git init - initiate repository

    touch index.html - create new file

    git add index.html - add specified file to staging area so that the changes will be commited to the repository next time we commited
        git add . will add all files with changes to staging area
    
    git commit - commits changes to repository
    git commit -m - allows us to connect a message with our commit

    git log - shows the commits that have been made so far

Branching
    Default branch is master

    branches allow people to work seperately on a file then merge them together after approval

    git branch allows you to see what branches you have

    git checkout -b name_of_brench will create a new branch and switch you to working in it in one line
    
    git branch -d name_of_branch will delete specified branch
        If commits were made in branch you would like to delete you must merge the branch to use -delete

        If commits were made and you want to delete the branch without merging use -d

    git merge name_of_branch will merge specified branch with branch you are currently in
        Depending on history of our commits, merge will either be a: 
            Fast forward merge
            Recursive merge

git push will push the master branch to github

git push origin branch_name will push a branch that is not the master branch
