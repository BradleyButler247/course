rest (...)
    rest operator is the same as the spread operator, it depends on the context they're in

    when ... appears in a function it is a rest operator

    it is the last parameter defined in a function and will evaluate to an array of all additional arguments passed in

    function sum(...nums) {
        nums.reduce((sum,n) => sum + n);
    }

    this will convert the nums provided when the function is call into an array then reduce it into the sum

    const sumAll = (...vals) => {
        return values.reduce((sum,n) => sum + n);
    };
